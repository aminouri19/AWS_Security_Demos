Cloudformation init or Cfn-init is used in a cloudformation template to add metada data.
For example if you want to install an instance and create a file in the instance or install
a software package afterwards you can use Cfn-init. The following template will install an 
EC2 instance and also add a file to a specific path afterwards.
