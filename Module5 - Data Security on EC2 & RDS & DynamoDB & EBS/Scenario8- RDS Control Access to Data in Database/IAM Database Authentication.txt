IAM Datbase Authentication

When creating the RDS database, under "database authentication", select 
"password and IAM database Authentication", this will allow Authentication
using IAM users. This is also required if we want to allow an EC2 instance to access
the RDS database using an IAM role. If changing this option for an existing db, choose apply
immediately.

1- Create a role for EC2 and allow access to RDS. This requires a specific policy that must be used below.
In the resource section we can see that the IAM user is added at the end of the db arn.
Note: Admin users can connect to the instance with no problem. This example is allowing a non admin user to connect.
If you see an error message during policy creation just ignore.

Arn under resource should be populated as follows
"arn:aws:rds-db:<region>:<Account ID>:dbuser:<DbiResourceID>/<db user name>"

To find the dbiResourceID, use the following command:
*	aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,DbiResourceId]"

Use the following command to find every detail about your database
*	aws rds describe-db-instances --region us-west-2
                    

{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "rds-db:connect"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:1234567890:dbuser:db-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/db_user"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

2- Attach role to EC2 instance

3- ssh into the instance and connect to the database using the following command
*	mysql -h <host or database endpoint> -P 3306 -u <master db username> -p

4- While in the mysql> prompt, create a user in mysql and specify that the user will use IAM for authentication
*	CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin as 'RDS';

5- Exit the mysql> prompt and run the following command on EC2 to create an RDS db authetication token (This will generate a temporary tocken that will expire in 15 minutes and will be used as the password)
*	aws rds generate-db-auth-token --hostname <database endpoint> --port 3306 --username <IAM username>

6- Copy the token from the terminal and save in a file

7- RDS database creates a SSL certificate when the datbase is created, if we enable "SSL Certificate Verification",
   the ssl certificate will be created using the database name. Download the root CA (rds-ca-2019), using the following command.
*	wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
*	mysql -h <database endpoint> --ssl-ca rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem  --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY -u <username> -p

8- Open mysql workbench and connect to the db instance using ssl

9- Run the following commands
*	RDSHOST="<rds endpoint>"
*	TOKEN="$(aws rds generate-db-authentication-token --hostname $RDSHOST --port 3306 --region us-west-2 --username <username>)"
*	mysql --host=$RDSHOST --port=3306 --ssl-ca=<ca cert> --enable-cleartext-plugin --user=<username> --password=$TOKEN
