Create a bucket
aws s3 mb s3://report-am-1 --region us-west-2

Upload file to bucket
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://report-am-1

Download a file from s3
aws s3 cp s3://report-am-1/test.txt

Delete bucket
aws s3 rb s3://report-am-1

Delete files inside the bucket recursivley
aws s3 rm --recursive s3://report-am-1

Delete bucket with force without recursive content deletion
aws s3 rb --force s3://report-am-1

Note: If the bucket has versioning enabled, we can't delete it using the cmd. 
We need to right code using python or javascript.
