Windows Commands

Step1: Calculate the hash of the file
*	Certutil -hashfile <file name> md5

Step3: Calculate the hash again

Linux Commands

Step1: Calculate the hash of the file
*	md5sum <file name> 

Step2: Make change in the file or tamper

Step3: Calculate the hash again
*	md5sum <filename>


This shows that the hash value has changed
indicating the file has been tampered with.
