Using AWS Organization we can centrally govern our environment.

We can use AWS Organizations for the following:

1- Manage Billing
2- Manage Access Control
3- Compliance
4- Security

We can enforce tags using SCP's (Service Control Policies).
To validate tag values we can use AWS Organizations tag policies.


Important tags:
1- "Owner": when users create resources either manually or programatically, we can configure
policies that allow users to only view and access resources they own using this tag.

2- "Type": This tag will assist when searching, filtering and securing specific resource types. 

3- "Cost Center": This tag will assist with billing and finding where the cost of this resource should be applied to.

4- "Region": This tag will assist in finding resources in specific regions

5- "Project": This tag will allow us to find all resources that belong to a project.
It also helps us understand the costs related to this project.

6- "Department": This tag will show the resources used in a specific department.

Appendix:
The following policy will help enforce a project tag on all new resources created using cloudformation.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:CreateStack"
      ],

      "Condition": {
        "Null": {
          "aws:RequestTag/Project": "true"
