Man in the middle attacks with Fiddler

1- Install web proxy fiddler and start 
capturing traffic

2- Run the following command
*	aws s3 ls

An error message will pop up showing that 
Certificate verification failed. 
This happens because fiddler is intercepting
traffic as a proxy server and ssl requests 
believe this is not secure.

3- Run the command again without SSL verification
*	aws s3 ls --no-verify-ssl

Although a warning message pops up, but the
command will go through. This proves SSL 
verification is important against man in the
middle attacks

4- Select the Composer tab in Fiddler. 
Copy the http request and paste it in the 
box. This clearly shows we are hashing our 
request and also using our Access Key for 
Authn and Authz. The signature shows the 
hash value of the request.

5- Click on execute and we can see that the
request will be replayed. Replaying the 
request is possible for 5 minutes.

6- To prove we can't tamper the request, 
change the region and replay the request. 
You should recieve a 400 error message 
meanining the server will not process this 
request. Proving we can't tamper the request.
