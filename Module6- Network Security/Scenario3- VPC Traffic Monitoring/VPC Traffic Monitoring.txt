VPC Traffic Monitoring

In this scenario we will capture traffic that has been sent from one instance to another.
It appears that one instance wants to ping another instance but it's blocked. We will detect
why it's blocked and resolve the issue. We will also use filters to direct/view only desired
traffic.
