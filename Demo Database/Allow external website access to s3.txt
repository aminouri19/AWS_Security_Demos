Restricting access to a specific HTTP referer
Suppose that you have a website with a domain name (www.example.com or example.com) with links to photos and videos stored in your Amazon S3 bucket, DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET. 
By default, all the Amazon S3 resources are private, so only the AWS account that created the resources can access them. 
To allow read access to these objects from your website, you can add a bucket policy that allows s3:GetObject permission with a condition, using the aws:Referer key, that the get request must originate from specific webpages. 
The following policy specifies the StringLike condition with the aws:Referer condition key.

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Id":"http referer policy example",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"Allow get requests originating from www.example.com and example.com.",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":"*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject","s3:GetObjectVersion"],
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*",
      "Condition":{
        "StringLike":{"aws:Referer":["http://www.example.com/*","http://example.com/*"]}
      }
    }
  ]
}
Make sure the browsers you use include the HTTP referer header in the request.

Important
This key should be used carefully. It is dangerous to include a publicly known referer header value. Unauthorized parties can use modified or custom browsers to provide any aws:referer value that they choose. 
As a result, aws:referer should not be used to prevent unauthorized parties from making direct AWS requests. It is offered only to allow customers to protect their digital content, such as content stored in Amazon S3, from being referenced on unauthorized third-party sites.
For more information, see aws:referer in the IAM User Guide.
