Calculate object hash on windows

1- Open Powershell
2- Run the following command on your file to calculate the sha256 hash
*	get-filehash test.txt -algorithm sha256
3- Convert hash to base64 using the following commands
*	$hashString = '5891B5B522D5DF086D0FF0B110FBD9D21BB4FC7163AF34D08286A2E846F6BE03'
*	$hashByteArray = [byte[]] ($hashString -replace '..', '0x$&,' -split ',' -ne '')
*	$ContentSHA256 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($hashByteArray)
*	echo $ContentSHA256
4- Open S3 and click upload file.
5- In the bottom click properties
6- In the additional Checksum settings click "on" and select sha256
